                    This is the latest project currently being worked on, the whole idea is to work on polishing a character controller as much as possible and showing them off in a cool Norse mythology mixed with technology setting. We've also implemented a simple wave-based gamemode to show off the combat.

                    </ul>
                    Big Boys is the fourth project that Angus and I created. I wanted to learn how to use Unreal Engine 4, and improve my C++ knowledge whilst experimenting with multiplayer. That's why we decided to make a multiplayer brawler with all of our friends modelled in as characters.

                    The concept of the game is quite simple, you load into the match, pick up a hammer and try to hit other players into toxic sludge or into spikes. We went wild with the design, movement and animation seeing as we made the game mainly for our friend group.

                    The project provided a lot of experience with writing game features with multiplayer in mind and as a whole taught us how to use Unreal. Personally, I also had a lot of fun rigging and animating.

                    </ul>
                    Doris is the first project my artist mate Angus Jardine and I decided to make. We needed experience before we worked on anything larger scale, which is why we created a short top-down RPG where the player defeated monsters and made their way to the final boss.
                    <br>
                    Doris features a modular armour system, inventory, shop, and enemies would drop randomised bags of items depending on their loot tables. Each item had its own stats and we created multiple armour sets that the player could find.
                    <img style="width: 100%; margin: 10px 0 10px 0;" src="gifs/doris/dorisclip1.gif" alt="Card image cap">
                    The player could sell items at the traders and buy potions or other items to help them on their journey. The inventory/shop and modular armour systems were by far the most difficult to create, especially as they all had to be able to interact with each other.
                    <img style="width: 100%; margin: 10px 0 10px 0;" src="gifs/doris/dorisclip2.gif" alt="Card image cap">
                    Although the game was quite buggy and the combat felt sluggish, we felt very satsified with the game as our first project and we ended up learning a lot.

                    The final boss arena was similar to Kitava in Path of Exile or Belial from Diablo 3. The boss would hit the ground, releasing projectiles that had to be dodged and occasionally making boulders fall while spewing vomit. After the boss was defeated, the game would end.

                    </ul>
                    6 Bodies is the third game Angus and I made. After finishing Johnny's Deathwish, we wanted to get experience creating a 3D experience - we decided to make a short horror game demo. 
                    <br>
                    The game starts with a cutscene of the player driving to a gas station with a radio playing in the background. Once the player exits the car, they can explore the surroundings, keep listening to the radio, or just fill up their car and head inside the gas station. 
                    <img style="width: 100%; margin: 10px 0 10px 0;" src="gifs/6bodies/6bodiesclip1.gif" alt="Card image cap">
                    6 Bodies' main antagonist is a 2D sprite portraying a tall creepy man. The player ends up getting locked inside the gas station, and has to make their way into the basemant where the main part of the game takes place.
                    <img style="width: 100%; margin: 10px 0 10px 0;" src="gifs/6bodies/6bodiesclip2.gif" alt="Card image cap">
                    The large basement is used as a hunting ground for the AI, if the player gets caught, they die and return back to the beginning of the basement.

                    The player has to sneak their way around the basement, looking for keys and ways through while dodging encounters with the hunter AI. The main objective is to open a big metal door at one of the basement and reach it, after which the demo ends.

                    We went for the Daggerfall approach of portraying the creepy man, making sprites of multiple angles and switching them based on where the AI was looking relative to the player. The AI has the following behaviours:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Patrolling by picking random spots in the basement to walk to</li>
                      <li>Greatly speeds up when the player is unable to see him, this increases the potential for jump scare moments and means that the player feels less safe</li>
                      <li>Begins hunting the player if he seems him within his range or can hear the footsteps (depending on if the player is walking/crouching/sprinting)</li>
                      <li>Loses the player if he doesn't see him for a duration of time </li>
                    </ul>

                    </ul>
                    After completing Doris, Angus and I were set on making a larger and more polished project. We decided on making Johnny's Deathwish, a challenging 2D sidescroller.
                    <img style="width: 100%; margin: 10px 0 10px 0;" src="gifs/johnny/johnnyclip1.gif" alt="Card image cap">
                    The goal of this project was to create our own polished 2D character controller that we could throw into a bunch of levels with a variety of traps.
                    <br>
                    Instead of waiting to finish the game, we were sending builds to our friends almost every week from the start, in order to get feedback on the feel of the character and the difficulty of the levels. This helped us find bugs that we were previously unaware of, which was a massive improvement over our first project - Doris.
                    <br>
                    The biggest challenge in the making of this project was the creation of the character controller as it needed to be able slide down and climb between walls, with many different potential edge-case scenarios that could break it.
                    <img style="width: 100%; margin: 10px 0 10px 0;" src="gifs/johnny/johnnyclip2.gif" alt="Card image cap">
                    Angus and I worked on a large array of traps:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Boulders</li>
                      <li>Spikes</li>
                      <li>Saws</li>
                      <li>Timed Lasers</li>
                      <li>Turrets</li>
                      <li>Swinging blades</li>
                    </ul>
                    We used these to create a variety of challenges for the player to overcome, and to avoid overuse of the same traps in different levels.

                    The later levels feature 'Builder' AI, they're capable of jumping over pitfalls and climbing walls in order to hunt the player down. These were by far the most fun to program and test.

                    A total of 4 regions and 27 levels were made, the final level of the game features a boss fight against the man that stole Johnny's ducky. The boss has three phases: rotating around the arena and spewing lasers + projectiles, charging the player horizontally, and finally, going invulnerable while spawning two flying AI.
