                                   Big Boys is the fourth project that Angus and I created. I wanted to learn how to use Unreal Engine 4, and improve my C++ knowledge whilst experimenting with multiplayer. That's why we decided to make a multiplayer brawler with all of our friends modelled in as characters.

                                   The concept of the game is quite simple, you load into the match, pick up a hammer and try to hit other players into toxic sludge or into spikes. We went wild with the design, movement and animation seeing as we made the game mainly for our friend group.

                                   The project provided a lot of experience with writing game features with multiplayer in mind and as a whole taught us how to use Unreal. Personally, I also had a lot of fun rigging and animating.

                                   Doris is the first project Angus and I decided to make. We needed experience before we worked on anything larger scale, which is why we created a short top-down RPG where the player defeated monsters and made their way to the final boss.
                                   <br>
                                   Doris features a modular armour system, inventory, shop, and enemies would drop randomised bags of items depending on their loot tables. Each item had its own stats and we created multiple armour sets that the player could find.
                                   <img loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; margin: 10px 0 10px 0;" src="gifs/doris/dorisclip1.gif" alt="Card image cap">
                                   The player could sell items at the traders and buy potions or other items to help them on their journey. The inventory/shop and modular armour systems were by far the most difficult to create, especially as they all had to be able to interact with each other.
                                   <img loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; margin: 10px 0 10px 0;" src="gifs/doris/dorisclip2.gif" alt="Card image cap">
                                   Although the game was quite buggy and the combat felt sluggish, we felt very satsified with the game as our first project and we ended up learning a lot.
                                   <img loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; margin: 10px 0 10px 0;" src="gifs/doris/dorisclip3.gif" alt="Card image cap">
                                   The final boss arena was similar to Kitava in Path of Exile or Belial from Diablo 3. The boss would hit the ground, releasing projectiles that had to be dodged and occasionally making boulders fall while spewing vomit. After the boss was defeated, the game would end.

                                   6 Bodies is the third game Angus and I made. After finishing Johnny's Deathwish, we wanted to get experience creating a 3D experience - we decided to make a short horror game demo.
                                   <a href="https://hermitsworlds.itch.io/six">itch.io page</a>
                                   <br>
                                   The game starts with a cutscene of the player driving to a gas station with a radio playing in the background. Once the player exits the car, they can explore the surroundings, keep listening to the radio, or just fill up their car and head inside the gas station.
                                   <img loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; margin: 10px 0 10px 0;" src="gifs/6bodies/6bodiesclip1.gif" alt="Card image cap">
                                   6 Bodies' main antagonist is a 2D sprite portraying a tall creepy man. The player ends up getting locked inside the gas station, and has to make their way into the basemant where the main part of the game takes place.
                                   <img loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; margin: 10px 0 10px 0;" src="gifs/6bodies/6bodiesclip2.gif" alt="Card image cap">
                                   The large basement is used as a hunting ground for the AI, if the player gets caught, they die and return back to the beginning of the basement.
                                   <img loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; margin: 10px 0 10px 0;" src="gifs/6bodies/6bodiesclip3.gif" alt="Card image cap">
                                   The player has to sneak their way around the basement, looking for keys and ways through while dodging encounters with the hunter AI. The main objective is to open a big metal door at one of the basement and reach it, after which the demo ends.
                                   <img loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; margin: 10px 0 10px 0;" src="gifs/6bodies/6bodiesclip4.gif" alt="Card image cap">
                                   We went for the Daggerfall approach of portraying the creepy man, making sprites of multiple angles and switching them based on where the AI was looking relative to the player. The AI has the following behaviours:
                                   <ul>
                                       <li>Patrolling by picking random spots in the basement to walk to</li>
                                       <li>Greatly speeds up when the player is unable to see him, this increases the potential for jump scare moments and means that the player feels less safe</li>
                                       <li>Begins hunting the player if he seems him within his range or can hear the footsteps (depending on if the player is walking/crouching/sprinting)</li>
                                       <li>Loses the player if he doesn't see him for a duration of time </li>
                                   </ul>

                                   Sleepless Kevin was made over a single weekend for a game jam, the main idea is that you play as an insomniac named Kevin during one night of his life.
                                   You keep keep getting up during the night because of various issues, but you end up having increasingly frequent encounters with a ghost 'handy man' as the night
                                   progresses.

                                   The game starts off with a talk with Kevin's therapist, after which Kevin finds himself in multiple encounters with a ghost that haunts his apartment... for better or worse. Below are some

                                   After completing Doris, Angus and I were set on making a larger and more polished project. We decided on making Johnny's Deathwish, a challenging 2D sidescroller.
                                   <a href="https://hermitsworlds.itch.io/johnnys-deathwish">itch.io page</a>

                                   The goal of this project was to create our own polished 2D character controller that we could throw into a bunch of levels with a variety of traps.
                                   <br>
                                   Instead of waiting to finish the game, we were sending builds to our friends almost every week from the start, in order to get feedback on the feel of the character and the difficulty of the levels. This helped us find bugs that we were previously unaware of, which was a massive improvement over our first project - Doris.
                                   <br>
                                   The biggest challenge in the making of this project was the creation of the character controller as it needed to be able slide down and climb between walls, with many different potential edge-case scenarios that could break it.
                                   <img loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; margin: 10px 0 10px 0;" src="gifs/johnny/johnnyclip2.gif" alt="Card image cap">
                                   Angus and I worked on a large array of traps:
                                   <ul>
                                       <li>Boulders</li>
                                       <li>Spikes</li>
                                       <li>Saws</li>
                                       <li>Timed Lasers</li>
                                       <li>Turrets</li>
                                       <li>Swinging blades</li>
                                   </ul>
                                   We used these to create a variety of challenges for the player to overcome, and to avoid overuse of the same traps in different levels.

                                   The later levels feature 'Builder' AI, they're capable of jumping over pitfalls and climbing walls in order to hunt the player down. These were by far the most fun to program and test.
                                   <img loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; margin: 10px 0 10px 0;" src="gifs/johnny/johnnyclip4.gif" alt="Card image cap">
                                   A total of 4 regions and 27 levels were made, the final level of the game features a boss fight against the man that stole Johnny's ducky. The boss has three phases: rotating around the arena and spewing lasers + projectiles, charging the player horizontally, and finally, going invulnerable while spawning two flying AI.

                                   In our latest project, Angus and I decided we wanted to really focus on creating a polished top-down 2D experience. Vampire Survivors and other similar horde games have a
                                   fairly straight forward and satisfying gameplay loop: kill monsters -> game gets harder -> upgrade your character -> kill more monsters. We decided that this simple
                                   gameplay loop was a perfect starting point for building upon and creating a fun, polished and replayable gameplay demo, with the possibility of being able to expand it
                                   in the future.

                                   <br />
                                   The game is still in development but all the main systems and goals have been completed, here's a quick look at our ability system.
                                   <br />
                                   <br />
                                   <iframe width="700" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EnYBND9rzfE"> </iframe>
                                   <br />
                                   <br />
                                   The player starts off with two main abilities (for example, the roll and arrow shot). They can upgrade their character every time they level up to get:
                                   <ul>
                                       <li>Passive abilities - these include, fireballs that shoot out and explode, bombs that drop on the ground or even knives that circle around the player</li>
                                       <li>Active ability modifiers - augments to the active abilties that can be used to set enemies alight or make them spawn poison ground once they die </li>
                                       <li>Runes - these are stackable modifiers that affect all your abilities. More projectiles, critical strike chance, projectile speed, attack speed etc.</li>
                                   </ul>
                                   <br />

                                   We were struggling a lot with performance, especially having more than 400 enemies on screen. I spent some time learning the Unity Data Oriented Technology Stack and
                                   converted all our projectiles/attacks and enemies to be entities for massive performance gains. This involved rebuilding our enemies and projectiles from ground up to
                                   to be controlled by a number of custom DOTS systems and jobs, most of which are now parallelised. As you can see below, Unity doesn't break a sweat handling even
                                   1000 enemies now.
